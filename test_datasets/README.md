## place for datasets/ primer pairs that are useful in testing and recording results

### primer sequences and designation compiled from a combination of insertion sites in 
"The Bacteriophages of Streptococcus pyogenes", W. MICHAEL MCSHAN, et. al(2019)

"Prophages and satellite prophages are widespread in Streptococcus and may play a role in pneumococcal pathogenesis" R. Javan et al. (2019)

sequences to form the primer sites were initially extracted from M1 strain MGAS5005, though validation of primer sequences being present in reference genomes or global population as core genes is desired
